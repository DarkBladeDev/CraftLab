# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Paper 1.21 Component Item Assembly
The Paper adapter SHALL assemble native Paper 1.21 ItemStacks using modern item data components, persist deployed items to `items.json`, and serve them via the `/mcp give` command.

#### Scenario: Item compilation and local persistence
- **WHEN** the Paper adapter handles `create_or_update_item`
- **THEN** it maps the canonical JSON definition to a native Paper 1.21 ItemStack, persists the definition in `items.json`, and records the item in the active item registry

#### Scenario: Giving item to player via command
- **WHEN** an operator runs `/mcp give <player> <item_id>` for an existing deployed item
- **THEN** the plugin retrieves the item definition from the active registry and gives the assembled ItemStack with correct name, lore, model data, and components to the target player
